              rice in bulk due to the very nature of the commodity, is a major
              roadblock. c) Since, the rice-ielated operations of FCI form a
              major part of the overall scale of operations, non-use of Silos
              for storing rice does not allow tor leveragtng the efficiencies

              storing the food grains, which can be a special advantage.

              vehicle velocity by Doppler shift; however, DVL operations are
